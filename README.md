Credit Risk Analysis
Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to assess the performance of a logistic regression model in predicting credit risk. By leveraging a labeled dataset, the model aims to identify loans that are either healthy (label: 0) or high risk (label: 1). 
This information can be used by financial institutions to make informed decisions about loan approvals and risk management.

The analysis consists of three key tasks:

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Creating and evaluating a logistic regression model.
Writing a report summarizing the model's performance and recommendations.

Summary
The logistic regression model demonstrated the following:

A relatively high accuracy, which indicates that the model correctly classifies most loans.
Strong precision for identifying high-risk loans, minimizing the likelihood of false positives.
Robust recall for healthy loans, ensuring most healthy loans are correctly identified.
Recommendation
Based on the performance metrics:

If the primary goal is to minimize financial risk, the model is suitable for deployment. Its strong precision for high-risk loans ensures that most flagged loans are genuinely high risk.
If the model's recall for high-risk loans is suboptimal, additional improvements, such as using more features or trying alternative machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest or Gradient Boosting), may be necessary.
